# Autoclip

### Heavily inspired by skrommel's AutoClip

Short and simple script that can be used to input preset text on hotkey

Hotkeys and text they input can be configured by right clicking the AHK icon in the system tray

Hotkeys are also saved (and can be changed if brave enough) in Macros.txt
